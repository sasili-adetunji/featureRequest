# featureRequest

This application allows user (employee of a company) to add a new feature that will be added onto an existing piece of software. 
The information is entered after having some correspondence with the client that is requesting the feature.

### The Approach
- I created a `User` model which store a user's info and password.
- I created a `Client` model which store the type of the clients and priority. This is done so as to relate a particular client to requests 
and reorder its priority
The Client model is `related` to `Feature` Model. The feature model is used to hold the request information
(title, description, product area, target date.). This is in addition to clients information which is gotten from the Client 
model.
- A user has to register and login before gaining access to the dashboard
- A user can add and view feature requests.
